        The first time I want to solve this by set i, j and use binary method
        to make it closer to the "middle"
        But how to determine i and j and their relation is difficult
        The problem is that I forgot i and j has relation and we should use i to calculate j 
        or use j to calculate i, not determine them separated.
        Because the median means (i + j) * 2 = m + n generally.
